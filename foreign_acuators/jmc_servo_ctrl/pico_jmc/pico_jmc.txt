Program Name: JMC Servo Control with Raspberry Pi Pico

Description:
This program allows you to control a JMC servo motor using a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. 
The Raspberry Pi Pico communicates with the JMC servo motor via a suitable communication protocol (e.g., UART, I2C, SPI). 
The program provides a user-friendly interface to send commands and control the servo motor's position, speed, and other parameters.

Features:
- Establishes communication between Raspberry Pi Pico and JMC servo motor
- Sends commands to control the servo motor's position, speed, and other parameters
- Provides a user-friendly interface for easy control and configuration
- Supports various communication protocols (e.g., UART, I2C, SPI)
- Allows for precise and accurate servo motor control

Usage:
1. Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to the JMC servo motor according to the specified communication protocol.
2. Upload this program to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
3. Use the provided interface to send commands and control the servo motor.

Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller
- JMC servo motor
- Suitable communication protocol (e.g., UART, I2C, SPI)
- Wiring connections between Raspberry Pi Pico and JMC servo motor

Note:
Please refer to the documentation of your specific JMC servo motor and Raspberry Pi Pico for 
detailed instructions on wiring connections and communication protocol configuration.
