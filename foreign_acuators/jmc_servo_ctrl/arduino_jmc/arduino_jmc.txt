Program: JMC Servo Control with Arduino

Description:
This program allows you to control a JMC Servo motor using an Arduino board. 
It is compatible with various Arduino models such as Arduino Uno, Nano, Leonardo, Mega, and more.

Instructions:
1. Connect the JMC Servo motor to the Arduino board according to 
the wiring diagram provided by the manufacturer.
2. Upload this program to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE 
or any other compatible software.
3. Adjust the necessary parameters in the code, such as the servo pin, 
minimum and maximum angles, and any other specific settings required 
by your JMC Servo motor.
4. Once the program is uploaded and the connections are properly made, 
power on the Arduino board.
5. The program will initialize the servo motor and provide control options.
6. Use the specified input method (e.g., serial monitor, buttons, 
potentiometer, etc.) to send commands to the servo motor and control its 
position or movement.
7. Experiment with different commands and parameters to achieve the desired 
servo motor behavior.

Note:
- Make sure to provide sufficient power to the servo motor to avoid unexpected behavior or damage.
- Refer to the JMC Servo motor datasheet or user manual for detailed specifications and usage instructions.

Happy servo motor control with Arduino!
